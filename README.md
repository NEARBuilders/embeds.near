## Getting Started 

```
npm install
```

Then, run the command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`.

Go to [everything.dev/flags](https://everything.dev) and paste this value there.

Once set, see the locally served app at [embeds.near/widget/Feed](https://everything.dev/embeds.near/widget/Feed).
